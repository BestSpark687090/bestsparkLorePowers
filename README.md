# LorePowers
Powers on the Minecraft server side. Inspired by the Origins Mod.\
The plugin that adds powers from [NYNS's Recordkeeper](https://smp.axionspire.net) to Minecraft.
## Features
The plugin is very useful for servers!
- A simple power management system
- Many pre-programmed powers
- Powers can be a useful and cool rank perk, or something engaging for SMPs!
## Installing
The plugin is only compatible with Spigot and forks, such as Paper.
It has only been tested on Paper, though.
1. Download the latest release from the Releases tab.
2. Place the `.jar` file in your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Restart your server.
4. Once it is back online, use the `/lorepowers` command to add powers to players.
    - To do this, run `/lorepowers add (POWER_NAME) [player]`. If you don't add a player name, it will give the power to the current user.
    - When you get to the power name section, it will give you a tab-completable list of powers. We haven't yet posted a list of powers, but you can access one if you are a subscriber to [Aelithron's Patreon](https://patreon.com/cw/Aelithron).
## Reporting Bugs
Managing so many powers is complex, so you may find multiple bugs.
Please create a GitHub issue if you find any bugs in the plugin.
