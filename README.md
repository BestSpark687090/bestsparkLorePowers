# LorePowers
Powers on the Minecraft server side. Inspired by the Origins Mod.\
The plugin that adds powers from NYNS's Recordkeeper to Minecraft.\
All powers can be found [in this list](https://www.notion.so/aelithron/LorePowers-Powers-278c2b729938809f9448d979fc52fd98?source=copy_link).
## Features
The plugin is very useful for servers!
- A simple power management system
- Many pre-programmed powers
- Powers can be a useful and cool rank perk, or something engaging for SMPs!
- Easily code in custom powers
## Getting a Power
Want a custom power? You can subscribe to [Aelithron's Patreon](https://patreon.com/cw/Aelithron) on the Supernova ($10/mo) tier, and they will make one for you, as well as write lore to go with it.
Alternatively, if you don't want to pay (fair), you can code one yourself and submit a GitHub pull request. You will get these on the NYNS SMP, and can use commands to get them on your own server.
## Installing
The plugin is only compatible with Spigot and forks, such as Paper.
It has only been tested on Paper, though.
1. Download the latest release from the Releases tab.
2. Place the `.jar` file in your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Restart your server.
4. Once it is back online, use the `/lorepowers` command to add powers to players.
    - To do this, run `/lorepowers add (POWER_NAME) [player]`. If you don't add a player name, it will give the power to the current user.
    - When you get to the power name section, it will give you a tab-completable list of powers.
## Reporting Bugs
Managing so many powers is complex, so you may find multiple bugs.
Please create a GitHub issue if you find any bugs in the plugin.
For security issues, follow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/nynsrulers/LorePowers/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

This repository is part of a trial-run NYNS program. I will reward you on the NYNS SMP with 1-5 Opal Tokens for any meaningful bugs you find.
